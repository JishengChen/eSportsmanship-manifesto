# Visualizing ESportsmanship with Community Generated Data
This is my final project for data viz class and the beginning of my thesis.

The goal of this project is to gather the community opinion and consensus on sportsmanship in eSports and illustrate the results of what eSportsmanship is to the community in a interactive map.

## Project Procedure
### 1. Gathering data
I use Google form to gather data.

The key data in this form are the name of the value/behavior/rule and the number the 
### 2. Processing data
Initially I expetected to use P5JS built-in function to process the data. In my design, the data will be updated in real time after users interractive with my map, which obviously need a buffer to store my data. So I took this unsolved problem to Joey asking for help.

However, after discussing this problem with Joey, I realized the solution to this problem is beyond knowledge we learned in this class. Therefore, I took a compomised approach:instead of writing algorithm to process the data gathered via google form,  I process the data in google numers to process the data with average function and built a filtered data that can be used in my visualization. With this being done, I actually have two data: one collected from player community and one I revised and reformed manually. I know this kind of low-tech, but this is the best I can do.
### 3. Building Unit of the visual
I use class to build bubbles that illustrate the
